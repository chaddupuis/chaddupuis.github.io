I'm the founder, full stack developer, devops engineer, and primary author of the [Yin Yang House](https://yinyanghouse.com/).  The site is a freely offered and comprehensive Chinese Medicine / Acupuncture theory and practitioner networking site.  Constantly developed for over 20 years, it is used by students, practitioners, and generally interested people from around the world.  

<img style="float: right;" src="/assets/images/ckdzdogz.png">I have a Masters degree in acupuncture (M.Ac.) from the [Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences](https://www.mcphs.edu/academics/school-of-acupuncture) and ran a large acupuncture and wellness practice in Massachusetts and Tennessee for decades.  I continue to consult, [write](https://yinyanghouse.com/members/profile/2/#blog-posts-activity) and advocate.

I've spent much of my career in tech, primarily in higher ed at institutions such as MIT, UCSC and the U of Arizona.  I have a BS in [MIS](https://eller.arizona.edu/departments-research/schools-departments/mis) from the University of Arizona and post-graduate work in Educational Psychology.  

Currently, I am a system administrator at the University of Minnesota within the Health Sciences Infrastructure and Application Hosting group.  I primarily manage linux machines, web development environments, and ci/cd pipelines.
